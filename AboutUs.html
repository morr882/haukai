                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>My husband and I have been opened this restaurant a few years ago in the hope to bring our locals a traditional experience. Our restaurant Haukai specialises in Maori Kai, with Pakeha options and drinks also available. </p>
                    <p>Our love for traditional Maori Kai comes from both of our upbringing. Traditional recipes were taught to us as we enjoyed preparing the food as much as eating in it.</p>
                    <p>Kai plays an important part of our culture, from how we harvest the food to the moment it arrives on the table. Before we eat it is traditional to bless the food with a Karakia, a Maori Blessing. We want to be able to show our customers how proud we are of our culture and how important it is for them to be a part of it.</p>
